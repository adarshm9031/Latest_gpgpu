1. register_file_cache inherits from baseline_cache which inherit from cache_t
2. baseline_cache has:
	tag_array * m_tag_array
3. tag_array has:
	cache_block_t **m_lines => complete cache structure [n_banks * n_sets * assoc]
	m_lines[i] is updated with (new line_cache_block())
4. line_cache_block & sector_cache_block is inherited from cache_block_t, as cache_block_t, is an abstract structure and has two functions for each one for sector and other for line.
5. tag_array::tag_array:
	m_lines= new_cache_block_t*[Total cache lines]
	for sector:
		for(i->Total cache lines) : m_lines[i] = new sector_cache_block()
	for normal:
		for(i->Total cache lines) : m_lines[i] = new line_cache_block()
		

To remember:
1. whats the use of evicted_block_info ??? see how its getting updated and is affecting the cache_block_t addition/removal.
2. gpu_cache configuration has N/S to decide whether we want a sector or normal cache(line)
3. mf can be set to null for calling the line_cache functions.
